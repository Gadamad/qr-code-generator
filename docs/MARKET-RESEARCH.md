## What Users Hate Most

1. **"Free trial trap"** — codes stop working after 14 days unless you pay. QR-code-generator.com has 1.6/5 on Trustpilot
2. **Opaque pricing** — hidden auto-renewal, annual-only billing
3. **No customer support** — AI chatbots only, refund requests ignored
4. **Analytics limitations** — Bitly Core: only 30 days of data
5. **Outdated UX** — clunky interfaces, poor mobile support

## Where the Money Is

Static QR codes are free everywhere. Revenue comes from:
- **Dynamic codes** (editable URL after printing) — strongest moat
- **Scan analytics** (location, device, time)
- **Custom domains / white label**
- **API access**
- **Team collaboration**
- **Bulk generation** (enterprise)

## Retention Moats

1. **Printed materials trap** — once printed, you can't change the code. Must keep paying.
2. **Accumulated analytics data** — historical data doesn't transfer
3. **Integration dependencies** — CRM, marketing automation connections
4. **Custom domain lock-in** — DNS, SEO equity on short URLs
5. **Volume dependency** — hundreds/thousands of codes = massive migration effort

## Potential Entry Strategies

| Strategy | Why |
|---|---|
| Transparency-first | Market built on bait-and-switch. Honesty = differentiator |
| AI artistic QR codes | +30% more scans, fragmented tools, nobody integrated it yet |
| Developer API-first | Most platforms are GUI-first, devs underserved |
| Vertical focus | Restaurants, education, events — pick one, own it |
| Affordable white-label | Currently only on expensive enterprise plans |

## Revenue Model (If Pursued)

- **Free**: Unlimited static codes, full customization
- **Pro $9-15/mo**: Dynamic codes, analytics, API
- **Business $39-79/mo**: Bulk ops, custom domains, teams
- **White-label $99-199/mo**: Agency resale

## Reference Case

QR Tiger: $0 funding → $3.6M/year revenue through SEO and content marketing alone.
